Animal adoption smart contract system
Our focus:
The traditional process in pet adoption is 
Adopter approach organizations after searching for desirable pet
Adopter fill in registration form (including background check)
NGO staff verify the information and arrange meeting/discussion
NGO staff make decision in which adopter or whether an adopter is approved to adopt a pet
Adopter has to update and report the petâ€™s situation regularly. 

Our system will focus on facilitating the process by automation. Our main functions are:
Allow staff to insert animal information on the journal, with necessary information which will automatically generate the minimum token required for an animal
Assign token to adopter automatically based on the information on registration form


Assign the most suitable adopter to an animal by smart contract
*To simplify, our project will only focus on dogs and cats and exclude other kind of animals
